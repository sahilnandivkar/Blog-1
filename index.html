                    <br>
                    <p>My name is <b>Sahil,</b> and I'm a <b>Full-Stack Developer.</b> My Full Stack journey started
                        four years back in 2020. After passing higher secondary school in the same year, I pursued
                        admission for a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. From the very beginning, I've been
                        fond of technology, growing up watching sci-fi movies â€” I believe that's what ignited my love
                        for this field.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I completed my bachelor's last year in 2023 and am currently enrolled in a specialization course
                        in Full-Stack Development. The tech stack I've acquired over these years includes HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, Java, Spring Boot, React.js, MySQL, and PHP.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During my college days, I primarily focused on practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because
                        witnessing your creativity take shape from start to finish is truly gratifying. I remember my
                        first project vividly â€” a COVID awareness website. It was a simple one-page site with minimal
                        functionality, but it marked the genesis of my interest in web development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Even though that site wasn't overly impressive, it sparked a lasting fascination with creating
                        meaningful and accessible digital experiences. Today, armed with a Bachelor's degree in
                        Information Technology and ongoing specialization in full-stack development, my enthusiasm for
                        this field is stronger than ever.</p>

                            Solution</span></div>
                    <br>
                    <p>As every developer, I started my journey by searching for materials on YouTube and different
                        websites. The very first mistake I made was watching videos and simultaneously replicating the
                        code. It provided no real benefit to my learning. One day, I decided to create the frontend part
                        of a website from scratch, and I couldn't accomplish even 50% of what I had planned. It was a
                        moment of realization, and I decided to stop replicating codes simultaneously.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The second mistake I made was thinking that writing code on paper would help me remember it.
                        Sounds funny, right? It was my second mistake. Writing code in a book is not a bad thing; it's
                        an excellent way to build logic in programming (I'll talk about it in upcoming blogs, so stay
                        tuned). However, when it comes to more extensive codes â€” for example, languages like HTML with
                        opening and closing tags â€” it can make things a bit complex for a beginner. It might not be the
                        case for everyone, but I faced complexity issues, and it wasted plenty of my time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Feeling a bit disappointed, I decided to start from the very beginning. I found out that I needed
                        to build logic for the programming language. It was like having a bag full of tools, and it was
                        up to me to decide which tool to use for a specific requirement. This time, I watched many
                        tutorials available on YouTube. What I did differently was to watch the entire video, note down
                        important points, and create my own notes. Whenever I encountered errors, formatting issues, or
                        bugs while making websites, I referred to my notes for solutions. I still have those notes, and
                        I use them as a reference.</p>

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm not an expert, and I don't have years of experience in web development. I'm still on my
                        learning journey, discovering something new in this field each and every day. The IT field is
                        dynamic and constantly evolving, and while I may not be able to discuss the advancements in
                        technology like an experienced person, it's a long journey for me too. However, what I can share
                        are the mistakes I've made as a beginner, so you can avoid similar pitfalls and save time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p  style="color: #e93d27;"><b>Just follow these basic steps: </b></p>
                    <p>- Never copy-paste (at least as a beginner). It creates a bubble around you, giving the illusion
                        that you know everything, but in reality, you'll learn nothing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>- Try to build logic; attempt to understand how things work; question why a particular thing
                        yields
                        a specific response. Let your mind be flooded with questions because that's how you maintain
                        interest.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>- Strive to find solutions on your own (as much as possible). If not, seek help from every
                        possible
                        platform without hesitating. In the end, what matters is how well you've learned that concept.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>- Last but not least, don't give up. Learning programming can be frustrating at timesâ€”whether
                        it's
                        not finding a solution, facing a hundred bugs, or encountering any challenge. Don't give up.</p>
